        <h4 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="800" class="m-5 highlight center">What is the HSQSA?</h4>
        <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="800" class="mt-5 mb-5 wide">The HS Quantum Science Association (HSQSA) is an organization dedicated to spreading an interest in quantum computing and science amongst high schoolers. Although a growing number of high schoolers are interested in quantum science, the numbers are still very low due to the topic's inaccessibility for junior researchers; we aim to challenge the notion that quantum sciences are inaccessible by offering a variety of programs and opportunities.</p>
        <h4 data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="800" class="m-5 highlight center">Why was the HSQSA created?</h4>
        <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="800" class="mt-5 mb-5 wide">The main objective of the HSQSA is to inspire the next generation of scientists in the quantum world by allowing students to start exploring such fields at the high school level. Many students are not even aware of the existence of quantum computers, much less their potential. Our organization will not only allow interested students to find the resources they need but also students who have never even heard of quantum mechanics to explore it further. As a result of the increased accessibility of quantum science to the high school population, more students will be motivated to continue exploring quantum computing at the undergraduate level and beyond.</p>
